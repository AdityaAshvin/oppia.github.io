    Publishing an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    At present, explorations are not world-viewable when created. In order to
    make an exploration visible to other people, you will need to publish it.
    You can do this by clicking the 'Publish' button in the exploration editor
    navbar.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: At present, once an exploration is published,
    it cannot be unpublished. However, it can still be incrementally improved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that you can only publish an exploration that is structurally valid;
    this is done to avoid learners getting stuck and frustrated while playing
    it. The exploration warnings in the top right of the exploration editor
    will display any issues detected for your exploration, such as isolated
    cards and feedback-less self-loops. After you fix these, the exploration
    will become publishable.

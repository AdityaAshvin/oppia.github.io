  <p>Oppia's homepage also serves as a gallery of explorations. This page contains a list of all published, non-draft explorations on the server. If there are a lot of explorations, not all of them will be shown at once: scrolling down the page loads more. </p>
  <blockquote><img src="http://wiki.oppia.googlecode.com/git/images/gallery.png" width="620"></blockquote>
  <p>You can filter the list by searching for specific topics, or selecting particular categories and languages. (You can also change the default language settings on your Preferences page.) In the following screenshot, the user has selected the "Mathematics" category (circled in orange), so the gallery only shows only mathematics explorations. </p>

  <p>To play an exploration, click anywhere on its gallery tile. If you have editing permissions, an "Edit" option will also appear in the top right. </p>

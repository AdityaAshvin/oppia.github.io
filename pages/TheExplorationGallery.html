    The Exploration Gallery
  </h2>

  <p>
    After signing in to Oppia, you'll end up on the Home page. Even before you
    start creating your own explorations, there are a number of things you can
    do. You can click on the icon at the top left corner of the page to access
    the blog, join the discussion forum or access the Participation Playbook.
    You can also check out a variety of existing explorations in different
    categories, or create one of your own by clicking on "Create Exploration"
    at the top right.

    Below the banner, the homepage contains a list of all published, non-draft
    explorations on the server. If there are a lot of explorations, not all of
    them will be shown at once. As you scroll down, more will be loaded.
  </p>

    You can filter the list by searching for specific topics, or selecting
    particular categories and languages. (You can also change the default
    language settings on your Preferences page.) In the following screenshot,
    the user has selected the "Mathematics" category (circled in orange), so
    the gallery shows only mathematics explorations.

    To play an exploration, click anywhere on its gallery tile. If you have
    editing permissions, an "Edit" option will also appear in the top right
    of its tile.

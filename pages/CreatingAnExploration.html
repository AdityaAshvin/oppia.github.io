    Creating an Exploration
  </h2>

  <p>
    After you've played an exploration, why not try your hand at making one? To
    do so, click the "Create" button in the top navbar.
  </p>

  <img src="static/images/libraryCreateButton.png" style="width: 100%;">

  <p>
    This will open the Exploration Editor page.
  </p>

  <p>
    The page asks for a two things:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>A title.</strong> Pick a short, descriptive title that conveys
      the essence of your exploration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>An introduction.</strong> What is the exploration supposed to help the
      learner learn?
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Once you've done that, a blue button will appear in the bottom left. 
    Click it to add interactions such as equations, math expressions, maps,
    buttons and menus. Congratulations, you've created a new exploration!

    Learner Dashboard

  <p>
    Oppia's mission from the very start has been - "To help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way.". The "Learner Dashboard" has been designed and developed keeping this goal in mind. If you're a new user and you have signed in for the first time, here's how the learner dashboard would look -

    The page urges you to go out there and explore, learn new things! Once you start learning the page starts to look a bit different. It's primary goal is to track how much you've learnt which we believe is one of the crucial steps in learning. After all, if you don't know where you are, how will you get to where you want to be?

    Here's how the learner dashboard looks to an experienced learner.

    As you can see, all the information about your progress is neatly organized in the learner dashboard. On the left hand side you can see a menu which tracks different things. There's the completed section which keeps track of all the explorations and collections you have completed. Then there's the 'In Progress' section which tracks of all the explorations and collections currently being completed. Information within these is further divided into explorations and collections which makes it easier to see how far you've gotten.

  <p>
  You also have the option to sort the explorations by "Last PLayed", "Title" and "Category" each of which have their own utility. To select the sorting option just select the dropdown and the options would appear.

  The dashboard also keeps track of the creators to which you have subscribed. View all your favorite creators in one place and check out the content they have created by just clicking on their profiles.
